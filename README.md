# py-file-mover
## A Python service that allows you to specify rules to move different types of documents to different directories

Simple example, the `Downloads`-folder: Set `py-file-mover` to automatically move e.g. image files to the `Pictures`-folder on your device. At the moment the tool will be developed for Linux use only, but may get ported to Windows and macOS X at some point in the future.
